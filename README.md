# 251213_FerrofluidFields

This repository explores ferrofluid behavior under configurable electromagnetic fields, aiming to deliver interactive visualizations and reproducible experiments for design, research, and education.

## Features
- Parameterized field configurations for shaping ferrofluid responses.
- Real-time visualization hooks for capturing surface patterns and spikes.
- Scenario presets for repeatable experiments and demos.
- Data capture for exporting runs for analysis.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ekimroyrp/251213_FerrofluidFields.git`
2. Move into the project: `cd 251213_FerrofluidFields`
3. Set up your Python environment (3.11+) and install dependencies once they are added: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the upcoming simulation or visualization entrypoint once available to validate the setup.

## Controls
- Controls for running simulations and adjusting fields will be documented as modules are implemented.
- Planned controls include toggling field sources, adjusting field strength and offsets, and triggering snapshots or exports.
